 * It also allows to avoid conflict with Forge event buses when
 * subscribing single event handler instance to both {@link CoreEventBus}
 * and Forge bus. While {@link CoreEventBus} will handle this just
 * fine regardless of whether methods are decorated with
 * <code>@SubscribeEvent</code> or {@link SubscribeCoreEvent} annotation,
 * Forge bus will fail, as it demands that all methods decorated with
 * <code>@SubscribeEvent</code> annotation specifically receive events
 * that extend Forge's implementation of <code>Event</code>,
 * which {@link CoreEvent} itself does not inherit.

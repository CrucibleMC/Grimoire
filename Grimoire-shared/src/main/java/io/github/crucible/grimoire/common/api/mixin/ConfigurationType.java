/**
 * Because Forge mod loading system begins mod discovery much later than coremods

 * mods at the time of coremod loading will fail, since no mods are discovered and
 * added to classpath at that time yet, and hereby classes from them do not yet exist
 * in runtime. This creates a neccessity to split all registered mixin configurations
 * in two groups - those that target Minecraft/Forge itself, and hereby should be
 * applied as early as possible, and those that target other mods, which hereby
 * should be applied at the time classess from those mods are actually accessible.
